# Hello Sir/Ma'am

I wanted to let you know that I have completed the assignment you provided. I have organized the work into two main folders: "frontend" and "backend."

In the "frontend" folder, I utilized packages such as Axios and Bootstrap. Additionally, I implemented Hooks like useState and useEffect. You can run the frontend application using the **(npm start)** command.

In the "backend" folder, I used Express.js along with packages like Cors, Dotenv, Mongoose, and Nodemon. To start the backend server, you can also use the  **(npm start)** command.

Please let me know if you need any further information or assistance.

Sincerely,  
Rajan Kumar
